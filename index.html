1. How to hack my favorite website and manipulate CSS and HTML<br>
2. Messy code cna result in up to 4x the amount of development cost (time and resources) vs original product Development costs.<br>
3. Focusing on naming conventions is VERY important. New Deveopers should create a system they can consistenly use. THe name should be non-data-type specific, but should describe what the function does.<br>
4. Can someone please expalain in plain english the Object-oriented vs. Functional language debate???
